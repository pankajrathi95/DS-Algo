/*
#136 - https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory? 
SOLUTION: This works on the principle of Bitwise XOR as XOR of two same numbers is zero and the XOR of number and zero is the number itself.
