#82 - https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
